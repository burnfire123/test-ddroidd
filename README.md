# Test Ddroidd
This repository contains my attempt at solving Ddroidd's technical interview for Winter Internship 2022 programme.  
The technical interview is represented by a three-day challenge to design from scratch a website from a given example, with any technology being allowed.  
Website's theme was signing up in Ddroidd's aformentioned internship and it consists of 3 pages: a presentation page, a form page, and a finish page, all having a header (which I actually called for some reason "navbar" in my app) and a footer.
